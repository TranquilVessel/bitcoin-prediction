What you’ll find here

Overview
This project provides an end-to-end workflow for forecasting Bitcoin prices with an LSTM model. It includes data ingestion from public sources, preprocessing steps to align and normalize data, a modular LSTM model you can extend, and utilities to generate predictions that align with real-time timestamps.

Audience
- Data scientists who want a clear baseline for time series forecasting in crypto markets.
- Researchers who study price dynamics and want an accessible benchmark.
- Developers who want to build dashboards or alerts around forecasted price trends.

How this reads in practice
- You pull historical price data, clean it, and transform it into input features and target values.
- You train an LSTM model to learn from past sequences and forecast the next price step.
- You export the forecast for a horizon and align it with calendar timestamps to plot against actual prices.

Quick start

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- A Linux, macOS, or Windows development environment
- Basic familiarity with Python, notebooks, and command-line tools

Install and set up
- Create a virtual environment
- Install dependencies from the requirements file
- Start the data pipeline or the notebook that runs the experiments

Example steps
- Create and activate a virtual environment
  - Python -m venv venv
  - For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  - For macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
- Install dependencies
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run a notebook or a script
  - jupyter notebook
  - python scripts/train_model.py

What to expect after setup
- A data folder with preprocessed datasets
- A trained model checkpoint
- A notebook to reproduce experiments and explore predictions

Data pipeline

Data sources
- Historical Bitcoin price data from public sources such as crypto exchange APIs and public price indices.
- Optional macro-market indicators that can be added to features, such as trading volume, volatility proxies, and market sentiment indicators.

Preprocessing steps
- Deduplicate and normalize timestamps to a common cadence (e.g., daily or hourly).
- Handle missing values with simple imputation strategies to avoid gaps that derail sequence learning.
- Normalize features to stable ranges to improve model training dynamics.
- Create lag features and rolling statistics to help the model capture short-term and medium-term trends.
- Build input sequences: for each target, construct a window of past time steps (look-back) and a corresponding horizon anchor for the predicted price.

Feature engineering ideas
- Price features: open, high, low, close, volume
- Returns and volatility: log returns, rolling standard deviation
- Time features: day of week, hour of day, seasonality proxies
- Custom indicators: moving averages, RSI, MACD, rate of change

Data validation and integrity
- Validate timestamp alignment between input sequences and targets.
- Check for outliers and remove or cap extreme values when justified.
- Keep a log of preprocessing steps to ensure reproducibility.

Model design

Architectural choices
- Sequence-to-value or sequence-to-sequence style: the model takes a sequence of past prices and returns a forecast for the next step.
- LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies, with dropout to improve generalization.
- Optional dense layers after LSTM blocks to map learned representations to the target price.

Hyperparameters (illustrative)
- Look-back window: 30 to 60 time steps (adjust to data cadence)
- LSTM layers: 1 to 2 stacked layers
- Hidden units: 64 to 256 per layer
- Dropout: 0.2 to 0.5
- Activation: tanh in LSTM cells; ReLU or linear in dense heads
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning rate: 0.001 to 0.0001 with a scheduler
- Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Batch size: 32 to 128
- Epochs: early stopping based on validation loss

Why LSTM
- LSTMs handle long-range dependencies better than simple feedforward nets in time series.
- They can learn patterns across days or hours that influence future prices.
- A well-structured LSTM with proper regularization can generalize to unseen periods.

Regularization and stability
- Use dropout between layers to prevent overfitting.
- Apply L2 weight regularization if necessary.
- Normalize input features to stabilize learning.
- Early stopping based on a validation set prevents overtraining.

Training and evaluation

Data split
- Training set: historical data up to a chosen cutoff.
- Validation set: a recent slice to monitor generalization.
- Test set: the final portion used for reported metrics and robust evaluation.

Evaluation metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- R-squared as a supplementary measure of fit

Training workflow
- Load preprocessed sequences and targets
- Train the LSTM model on the training set
- Monitor validation loss and stop early if no improvement
- Save the best model checkpoint and the associated scaler/normalizer

Model interpretation
- Visualize training curves to assess convergence.
- Analyze residuals to identify systematic errors.
- Plot predicted vs actual prices for the validation and test periods.

Prediction and aligned timestamps

Forecast horizon
- Define a forecast horizon, such as the next 7 days or 24 hours, depending on the data cadence.
- The model outputs a forecast for each step in the horizon.

Timestamp alignment
- Ensure each forecast timestamp aligns with the corresponding calendar time.
- Use the same cadence as the training data to keep comparisons meaningful.
- Create a forecast dataframe with columns for timestamp, predicted price, and confidence proxies if available.

Prediction workflow
- Load the latest trained model and the data scaler
- Prepare the most recent time window as input
- Generate predictions for the desired horizon
- Denormalize predictions if features were scaled
- Save results to a CSV or display in a notebook for quick inspection

Expected outputs
- A BLOB of predicted prices aligned to the forecast timestamps
- Associated uncertainties or confidence intervals if implemented
- Plots showing forecast trajectories compared to real prices

Reproducibility and experiments

Environment and dependencies
- A dedicated virtual environment is recommended
- Pin versions in a requirements file to ensure reproducibility
- Document any optional libraries used for visualization or experimentation

Experiment tracking
- Record hyperparameters, data splits, random seeds, and results
- Store model artifacts, plots, and evaluation metrics in a structured folder
- Use a simple naming convention for experiments, such as exp-YYYYMMDD-HHMM

Notebooks and scripts
- Notebooks provide a narrative for the preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction steps
- Scripts enable automated runs for batch experiments
- Keep notebooks clean and well-commented for easy reuse

Performance and benchmarking
- Compare against simple baselines like moving averages or ARIMA to quantify gains
- Report improvements in RMSE and MAE relative to the baselines
- Show how the model handles different market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)

Production considerations
- If you plan to deploy, package the model and a small runtime to generate forecasts
- Ensure the deployment can fetch fresh data, preprocess it, and produce up-to-date predictions
- Include a minimal API or a command-line interface for integration with dashboards
